# Code for the paper "Efficient Qubit Routing for a Globally Connected Trapped Ion Quantum Computer" at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12782v1.pdf

3 separate pieces of code:

Error model and achievable depth and quantum volume calculator
  - Users can adjust values and see how it changes the value of QV_native as a function of two qubit gate fidelities. 
 
Lane priority ion routing simulation tool 2D representation
  - Requires pygame to be installed
  - Uses the lane priority routing described extensively in the paper
  - Can be configured for different data extraction

Positional swap ion routing simulation tool 2D representation
  - Requires pygame to be installed
  - Uses a positional swap based routing 
  - Can be configured for different data extraction
